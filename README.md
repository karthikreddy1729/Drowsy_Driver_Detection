# Drowsy_Driver_Detection
*   This is a project implementing Deep Learning concepts to detect drowsiness of a driver and sound an alarm if drowsy. It is built by real-time Eye-Tracking in videos.
*   Drowsy detection using OpenCV and Convolution Neural Networks.

## Requirements
*  Python 2.7
*  OpenCV
*  Keras
*  Tensorflow
*  Scipy

## Algorithm

Each eye is represented by 6 (x, y)-coordinates, starting at the left-corner of the eye (as if you were looking at the person), and then working clockwise around the eye.

* The model is saved as a json file 'model1' and the weights are saved in 'model.h5'

## Dataset
you can download the dataset from the link given (http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/xtan/data/ClosedEyeDatabases.html) ::
* =>Download the dataset and put it in a folder named dataset
The dataset contains 4 folders namely:

* closedLeftEyes
* closedRightEyes
* openLeftEyes
* openRightEyes

## Training the data
```
    python eye_training.py
```

## Testing the drowsiness with web-cam
~~~
    python drowsiness_prediction.py
~~~

* In the live web-cam it shows the time count of the closing of eyes and whether the driver opened or closed his eyes.
* when the count becomes greater than 15 then the alarm will start ringing and tells the driver is Drowsy.
